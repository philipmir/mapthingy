# Visual Effects Restored - Specification Compliant

## ✅ **Fixed Visual Effects**

I've restored all the visual effects that were accidentally removed when updating to specification-compliant status values.

### **Restored Effects:**

1. **Pulsing Markers** - Individual markers pulse when status changes
2. **Screen Flash Effects** - Red flash for alerts, green flash for recoveries  
3. **Alert Detection** - Automatic alert detection and notification
4. **Status Change Tracking** - Tracks recently changed machines

### **Updated Status Values:**

| Old Status | New Status | Visual Effect |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| `online` | `green` | Green pulsing on recovery |
| `warning` | `yellow` | Red pulsing on alert |
| `offline` | `black` | Red pulsing on alert |
| `error` | `red` | Red pulsing on alert |
| `grey` | `grey` | Red pulsing on alert |

### **Alert Detection Logic:**

**Alert Statuses (trigger red flash):**
- `yellow` - Active with warnings
- `red` - Active with errors  
- `black` - System not accessible
- `grey` - Not connected to SOSON

**Recovery Status (triggers green flash):**
- `green` - Active with no alarms

### **Visual Effects Working:**

✅ **Individual Marker Pulsing** - Markers pulse for 30 seconds after status change  
✅ **Screen Flash Effects** - Red flash for alerts, green flash for recoveries  
✅ **Alert Detection** - Automatic detection of machines needing attention  
✅ **Status Tracking** - Tracks recently changed machines for effects  
✅ **Recovery Effects** - Green flash when machines return to healthy status  

### **Effect Timing:**

- **Red Flash**: Triggers when machines change to alert status (yellow, red, black, grey)
- **Green Flash**: Triggers when machines recover to green status
- **Individual Pulsing**: 30-second duration for recently changed markers
- **Screen Flash**: 2-second duration with 3-second cooldown between flashes

All visual effects are now working with the specification-compliant status values!
